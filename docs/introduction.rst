Introduction
============

This is the user manual for the Lily Data Logger Studio CE. CE stands for Community Edition,
which is the free open source edition. The source code is available on GitHub and the software
can be used free of charge for personal and professional use.

There is also a XE version. XE stands for eXtended Edition. This edition is based on the CE,
but has an extra feature inside: the process runner. The process runner is capable of not only
doing the data logging, but also can control your complete test setup.

Next to the process controller, the XE has a bit more instrument drivers included. Also when you
buy the XE, you will get support from LilyTronics when using the software, creating processes and
adding your own instruments.

For the CE, LilyTronics does not provide any support other than this manual.

Included in both editions are simulators that can be used to try the software and all of the
features. Working with the simulators is covered in this manual.

Because it is open source anybody with some programming experience could modify the software and
release it under their name. However the original XE is only available through the
LilyTronics web site and will never be distributed through any other channel.
